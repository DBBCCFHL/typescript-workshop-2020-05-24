# Typescript Workshop

## Workshop structure â›©

Each section will include a lesson, exercise, and solution.

`lesson/` will act as out scratch pad during the lesson.

Within `exercise/` you'll find an `exercise.md` which outlines what you'll need to do.

`solution/` contains my solution to the questions in `exercise.md`

## How it works

Process for every lesson:

1. Lesson & Q&A
2. Exercise
3. Solution
