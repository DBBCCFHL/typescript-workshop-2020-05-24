# Exercise: Create your own create-react-app TS project

1. Using `npx` create a new React project using the typescript template

2. In `App.tsx`, define a function that takes **one** argument, `user`.

- `user` is an object with two properties; `firstName` and `lastName`. They are both strings.

- This function should return one string which is a concatenation of the two properties of `user`

- Use this function and display the string somewhere in the component.
