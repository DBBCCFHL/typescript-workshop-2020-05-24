# Exercise: Working with JS Libraries

1. Install `react-router-dom` and it's accompanying types

2. Make a small router with two routes in your app, `/` and `/about`

3. Install [`filled-array`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/filled-array) and create your own type definition file for it. Use it to create an array with a count of three, filled with your name. Render the array as an unordered list.
