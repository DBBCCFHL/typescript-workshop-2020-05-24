# Exercise: Defining an interface for Props

1. In `index.tsx`, define three interfaces so that our code will compile.

The three interfaces you'll need are:

```ts
interface Todo {}

interface TodoItemProps {}

interface TodoListProps {}
```

2. Having added all the interfaces, you should have on final error in your code. Use the details of the error to debug and correct it.
